			 <p>To improve sleep quality, focus on creating consistency and reducing stimulation before bed. Try going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day, even on weekends, so your body clock stabilizes. Make your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet, since temperature and light strongly affect deep sleep. Avoid screens for about an hour before bed because the light and mental stimulation can delay melatonin release. Limit caffeine in the afternoon and evening, and be careful with alcohol since it can make you fall asleep faster but disrupts restorative sleep later in the night. Regular daytime exercise and getting some morning sunlight help regulate your circadian rhythm, but intense workouts should be finished a few hours before bedtime. If your mind tends to race at night, a short wind-down routine such as deep breathing, light stretching, journaling, or meditation can signal to your brain that it is safe to relax. If sleep problems continue for weeks or you wake up feeling unrested 			despite enough time in bed, it may be worth speaking with a healthcare professional to rule out issues like insomnia or sleep apnea.</p>
